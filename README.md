It is a TensorFlow implementation of《[Facial Landmark Detection by Deep Multi-task Learning](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/TCDCN.html)》

>Instead of treating the detection task as a single and independent problem, we investigate the possibility of improving detection robustness through multi-task learning.
